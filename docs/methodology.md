# Multiobjective Energy System Optimization  
## A Comparison of Modelling Approaches and Tools

---

## 1. Introduction

Energy system optimisation problems are traditionally formulated with cost
minimisation as the primary objective. However, modern energy system planning
increasingly requires consideration of multiple, often conflicting objectives,
such as emissions reduction, efficiency, and system performance.

Multiobjective optimisation enables systematic exploration of these trade-offs
through the generation of Pareto-optimal solutions.

This study investigates different approaches for developing a multiobjective
energy system optimisation model using open-source tools. The focus is on how
energy system models can be formulated and evaluated within a multiobjective
optimisation framework, rather than on the performance of individual solvers.

Three modelling approaches are compared:

1. Component-based modelling using **oemof.solph**
2. Algebraic linear programming using **linopy**
3. Direct mathematical formulation within **pymoo**

## 2. Objectives of the Study

The objectives of this work are:

1. To evaluate different modelling approaches for multiobjective optimisation
   of energy systems.
2. To develop a representative energy system optimisation model using each
   approach.
3. To analyse how easily each model can be adapted for use with **pymoo**.
4. To identify the most suitable modelling strategy for flexible and scalable
   multiobjective energy system optimisation.

## 3. Reference Energy System

### 3.1 System Description

A simplified energy hub is used as a reference test case to ensure transparency
and comparability between approaches.

The energy system consists of:

**Energy sources**
- Natural gas grid
- Electricity grid

**Conversion technologies**
- Combined Heat and Power unit (CHP), converting natural gas into electricity
  and heat
- Heat pump (HP), converting electricity into heat

**Energy sinks**
- Thermal demand (fixed)
- Electricity excess (slack sink)

The model is evaluated for a single time step, representing steady-state
operation.

### 3.2 Optimisation Objectives

The optimisation problem considers two objectives:

1. Minimisation of total system cost
2. Minimisation of total CO₂ emissions

These objectives are conflicting, as lower-cost solutions may rely more heavily
on fossil fuel use, while lower-emission solutions may require increased
electricity consumption or higher operational costs.

---

### 3.3 Constraints

The energy hub is subject to the following constraints:

- Capacity limits for energy sources and conversion technologies
- Energy balance constraints at each conversion technology
- Demand satisfaction for the thermal load
- Non-negativity of all energy flows

---

## 4. Multiobjective Optimisation Framework

Multiobjective optimisation is carried out using the **pymoo** framework.
pymoo requires the optimisation problem to be expressed in terms of:

- A vector of decision variables
- A vector of objective functions
- A set of inequality constraints

Each modelling approach must therefore be adapted to provide objective and
constraint evaluations compatible with pymoo’s interface.

## 5. Modelling Approaches

### 5.1 oemof.solph-Based Model

In the oemof-based approach, the energy system is represented as a network of
buses, sources, sinks, and converters. For each candidate solution generated by
the multiobjective algorithm, an optimisation model is built and solved using
linear programming.

**Strengths**
- Intuitive, component-based representation of the energy system
- High flexibility for modifying system topology
- Well-established framework for energy system modelling

**Limitations**
- The optimisation problem is solved internally as a single-objective problem
- Additional objectives must be computed externally
- Computational overhead due to repeated solver calls

---

### 5.2 linopy-Based Model

In the linopy approach, the energy system is formulated explicitly as a linear
programming problem using array-based variables and constraints. This enables a
transparent mathematical representation of the optimisation problem.

**Strengths**
- Explicit control over variables, constraints, and objective functions
- Easier extraction of decision variables and objective values
- Well suited for systematic integration with optimisation algorithms

**Limitations**
- Requires manual formulation of all constraints
- Less intuitive for large or highly detailed energy system representations

---

### 5.3 Direct pymoo Formulation

In the direct pymoo approach, the energy system is formulated directly within
the pymoo problem class. Decision variables represent energy system quantities,
and objectives are evaluated directly within the optimisation loop.

**Strengths**
- Single-tool workflow without external model generators
- Direct implementation of multiobjective optimisation
- Low computational overhead per evaluation

**Limitations**
- Manual mathematical formulation increases the risk of modelling errors
- Less modular and less scalable for complex energy systems

## 6. Results and Discussion

All three approaches are able to generate feasible solutions and identify
trade-offs between cost and emissions. The resulting Pareto fronts demonstrate
the expected conflict between economic and environmental objectives.

### Model Build Validation

The mathematical model implemented using linopy is validated by comparison
against the oemof-based model. Objective values and energy flows are shown to be
consistent, confirming the correctness of the algebraic formulation.

### linopy–pymoo Optimisation

The combined linopy–pymoo approach successfully identifies Pareto-optimal
solutions. However, the approach requires additional effort to formulate the
mathematical model explicitly, and computational costs increase due to repeated
LP solves.

### oemof–pymoo Optimisation

The oemof–pymoo approach executes without errors but requires further refinement
to ensure reliable convergence. While feasible solutions are obtained, the
computational burden of repeated optimisation remains high.

### pymoo-Native Optimisation

The direct pymoo formulation requires careful mathematical modelling but
demonstrates accurate and efficient convergence once implemented. The resulting
Pareto front shows clear trade-offs and highlights the effectiveness of the
approach for systematic multiobjective analysis.

## 7. Conclusion

This report compared three modelling approaches for multiobjective energy system
optimisation using open-source tools. While all approaches are capable of
producing valid multiobjective results, their suitability depends on the
intended application.

Component-based models are advantageous for rapid prototyping and system
configuration changes, while algebraic and direct formulations are better suited
for scalable and flexible multiobjective optimisation workflows.
